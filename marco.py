# marco.py
#  Sends arp requests to the entire network range searching for the first response.
#  Creates a second thread to monitor for responses to allow the sending thread to just spew packets.
#  The whole point is to find a valid IP when on a completely quiet network segment without DHCP
#  or any other means to find a valid address.  
#  I couldn't seem to figure out how to get nmap to do an arp sweep on a network range that I didn't have 
#  an IP/interface associated with.  
# Requires: 
#  ipaddr (http://code.google.com/p/ipaddr-py/) and of course scapy (http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/)
